			<h1> Let the challenge begin </h1>
			You're eyes flicker open, the dark dank room
			just coming into focus. Light came in from a small
			crack in the ceiling illuminating a stony dungeon.
			Ivy encrusted the walls and a damp smell eminated from
			every stone.<br>
			The only way out appeared to be a large steal door. You
			run over, trying the lock, but it's stuck.
			However behind a string of ivy you find a keypad reading:
			Please Enter Password. hint: look at the walls.
			You look at the walls, ripping away all the ivy and
			there reads a message on a golden plaque on the wall:
			<h1> Instructions </h1>
			<ul>
				<li> Each room will have a riddle </li>
				<li> When you solve the riddle type your answer into the
				solution area with no spaces and all letters lowercase </li>
